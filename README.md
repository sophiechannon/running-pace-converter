# running-pace-converter
## An old HTML, CSS &amp; JS project that converts pace and speed ##

This is a very early project from when I started to teach myself to code in April 2020. The code is not pretty, but I learnt a lot doing it so I felt it was worth adding to my GitHub account for now, as evidence of previous explorations into coding.

It uses JS, HTML and CSS.

The front end only utilises the paceConverter.js code and the rest are works in progress.
